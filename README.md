# Algorithm & Data Structure Implementations

This repository contains my implementations of various algorithms and data structures, which I've created as part of my learning journey through Zero to Mastery course. Each implementation aims to demonstrate the concepts and provide a practical example of how each algorithm or data structure works.

- `Sorting Algorithms`: Implementations of different sorting algorithms.
- `Data Structures`: Custom implementations of data structures such as linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks, and queues.
